# demo-tags

This is a README.md file.  This first version I intend to tag v1.0.

And now I have added more text and will create a version I will tag v1.1.

Well, I really want to have some markup here, so that I can check rendering, so **this text** will be in bold!  Going to v1.2!

And lastly, adding some _more_ markup / markdown for v1.3.
